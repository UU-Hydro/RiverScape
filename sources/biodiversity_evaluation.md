Input folder
============

The input folder is given in the following location.


``` code
# set the current directory as the root directory
try:
    if root_dir == None: root_dir = os.getcwd()
except:
    root_dir = os.getcwd()

# by default, the input folder is given in the following location that is relative to the root directory (the current directory)
github_input_dir_source = os.path.join('..', 'input_files', 'input', 'bio')
input_dir_source = os.path.join(root_dir, github_input_dir_source)
```

You may also want to set the input folder, interactively, by running the
following cells.


``` code
# go to the above suggested 'input_dir_source'
os.chdir(input_dir_source); input_dir_source = os.getcwd()

# open an interactive window
get_input_dir_source = ""
# get_input_dir_source = select_directory()
# - if cancel or not used, we use the above suggested 'input_dir_source'
if get_input_dir_source == "" or get_input_dir_source == "()": get_input_dir_source = input_dir_source

input_dir_source = get_input_dir_source
```


``` code
msg = "The input folder is set to: {}".format(input_dir_source)
print(msg)

# return to the root folder for further processes.
os.chdir(root_dir)
```

Output folder
=============

Please set your output folder. It will be generated in case it does not exist. Please adjust the location if necessary.


``` code
output_folder_name = 'output_bio'
output_folder = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), output_folder_name)
if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.mkdir(output_folder)
```

You can also set the output folder interactively. Uncomment the following lines and run the
following cells.


``` code
# # open an interactive window
# get_output_folder = ""
# get_output_folder = select_directory()
# # - if cancel or not used, we use the above defined 'output_folder'
# if get_output_folder == () or get_output_folder == "": get_output_folder = output_folder

# output_folder = get_output_folder
```

To inspect the output path print it:

``` code
print('Output folder set to: {}'.format(output_folder))
```

The files in the input folder will be copied to the output folder. The
output folder will also be set as the working directory. All plots would
be saved in this directory.


``` code
# safe copying method
source = os.listdir(input_dir_source)
destination = output_folder
for files in source:
    shutil.copy(os.path.join(input_dir_source, files), destination)

#~ # dangerous copying method
#~ if os.path.exists(output_folder): shutil.rmtree(output_folder)
#~ shutil.copytree(input_dir_source, input_dir_source)

# use the output folder as the working directory
os.chdir(output_folder)
```

Reading input files
===================

To calculate biodiversity indices of protected and endangered species
that are characteristic of the fluvial environment, this notebook
applies the Spreadsheet Application For Evaluation of BIOdiversity
(BIOSAFE) model (see e.g.Â [de Nooij et al.,
2003](https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.779)). The original spreadsheet file in
an excel format is provided in the following location. We adopt the
excel file to this notebook.


``` code
# the original excel file
excelFile = os.path.join(output_folder, 'BIOSAFE_20150629.xlsx')
msg = "The original excel file is given on {}".format(excelFile)
print(msg)
```

We adopt the spreadsheet/excel file to this notebook.

The first input to the spreadsheet is a matrix **legalWeights**
(Legislative Weights) of user-specified weights for 16 different policy
and legislative documents. The 16 legal documents considered are the
most recent versions of: Dutch Red List species that are based on the
criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN),
Dutch Flora and Fauna Act, EU Habitat Directive, EU Birds Directive,
Bern Convention, and Bonn Convention. We assumed equal weights,
attributing equal value to the protection by each of the legal and
policy documents.

Please execute the following cells to load and visualize the
**legalWeights** used in this study.


``` code
legalWeights = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(output_folder, 'legalWeights.csv'), index_col = 0)
```


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(legalWeights)
```

The second input is **linksLaw** (Legal Links), which is a relational
matrix that links species(s) along the rows to the relevant policy and
legislative documents (**legalWeights**) along the columns. If a species
is protected by or mentioned in a specific law, the corresponding cell
in the matrix is given a value of one, else the cell is zero.

Please execute the following cells to load and visualize the
**linksLaw** used in this study.


``` code
linksLaw = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(output_folder, 'linksLaw.csv'), index_col = 0)
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(linksLaw)
```

The third input is **linksEco** (Ecotope Links), which is the relational
matrix between species and ecotopes. The matrix is based on expert
ecological judgement of species and their hydromorphological and
vegetation habitat needs in different life stages.

Please execute the following cells to load and visualize the
**linksEco** used in this study.


``` code
linksEco = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(output_folder, 'linksEco.csv'), index_col = 0)
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(linksEco)
```

The column titles in linksEco represent the ecotope classes used in this
study. In addition to them, we introduce their merged/main classes based
on the following relationship matrix **lut** that can be loaded and
visualized by executing the following notebook cells.


``` code
#~ # using excel file
#~ excelFile = os.path.join(output_folder, 'BIOSAFE_20150629.xlsx')
#~ lut = pd.read_excel(excelFile, sheet_name = 'lut_RWES').fillna(method='ffill')

# using csv file
csvFile = os.path.join(input_dir_source, 'lut_RWES.csv')
lut = pd.read_csv(csvFile, index_col = 0)
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(lut)
```

In the matrix **lut**, the column oldEcotope represents the ecotope
classes given along the top rows of linksEco, while the classes in the
column newEcotope are their merged ecotope classes. Based on **lut**
(relation between oldEcotope and newEcotope) and by running the
following notebook cells, we can derive and visualize the Ecotope Links
**linksNewEcoAgg**, consisting oldEcotope and newEcotope.


``` code
linksNewEcoAgg = biosafe.aggregateEcotopes(linksEco, lut)
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(linksNewEcoAgg)
```


``` code
print(linksEco.shape)
print(linksNewEcoAgg.shape)
```

Understanding/testing BIOSAFE in a simple instance (non-spatial mode)
============================================================================

To understand the BIOSAFE model, we introduce the following exercise
running the BIOSAFE model in a simple single instance, without relevant spatial information.

For this exercise, we randomly draw the presence of each species by
running the following cells. The assumption drawn is given in the table,
particularly in the column **speciesPresence**, with the values 0 and 1
indicating absent and present.


``` code
speciesPresence = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(2, size=len(linksLaw)),\
                    columns=['speciesPresence'], \
                    index=linksLaw.index)
speciesPresenceFull = speciesPresence
```



``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(speciesPresence)
```

For this exercise, we simplify all areas of ecotope classes
(**ecotopeArea**) equal to 1e5 m2. This is done by running the following
cell.


``` code
ecotopeArea = pd.DataFrame(np.ones(len(linksNewEcoAgg.columns)-1) * 1e5,\
                           columns = ['area_m2'],\
                           index = linksNewEcoAgg.columns.values[0:-1])
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(ecotopeArea)
```

Running the BIOSAFE in a simple single instance (non-spatial mode)
==================================================================

Given the inputs **legalWeights**, **linksLaw** and **linksNewEcoAgg**,
as well as the assumptions **speciesPresence** and **ecotopeArea**
defined above, the BIOSAFE model is initiated by running the following
cell.


``` code
bs = biosafe.biosafe(legalWeights, linksLaw, linksNewEcoAgg, speciesPresence, ecotopeArea)
```

Then, we can calculate all BIOSAFE scores (potential and actual ones).


``` code
SScoresSpecies = bs.SScoresSpecies()
summarySScores = bs.taxGroupSums()
SEcoPot = bs.SEcoPot()
SEcoAct = bs.SEcoAct()
PTE = bs.PTE()
ATE = bs.ATE()
TES = bs.TES()
TEI = bs.TEI()
ATEI = bs.ATEI()
TFI = bs.TFI()
FI = bs.FI()
ATFI = bs.ATFI()
AFI = bs.AFI()
FIS = bs.FIS()
TFIS = bs.TFIS()
TFHS = bs.TFHS()
FTEI = bs.FTEI()
```

Exploring the BIOSAFE scores/indices
================================

After running the BIOSAFE model, we would explore the BIOSAFE scores/indices by running the following cells. Note that we distinguish between **potential** biodiversity indices, which depend on ecotope presence only, and **actual** biodiversity indices, which combine ecotope and species presences. To understand the description of each score, we refer to the [supplementary material](http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/3/11/e1602762/DC1) of [Straatsma et al. (2017)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1602762) that provides all equations to calculate these scores. Figure S1 in the [supplementary material](http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/3/11/e1602762/DC1) shows the flow chart of the BIOSAFE methodology, while a graphical illustration of BIOSAFE score computation is given in Figure S2.

Note that during this exploration, you may want to skip some cells for visualizing some values in data frames or clear their outputs after executing them, particularly if they involve large data frames.

We start this exploration with **SScoresSpecies** that consists of the calculated potential and actual species scores, **Spotential** and **Sactual** (PSS and ASS in the paper). For each species, their calculated values are given as follows.


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(SScoresSpecies)
```

Based on SPotential and SActual, the potential and actual taxonomic group
scores, **PTB** and **ATB**, can be calculated for each taxonomic group as follows. In addition, the
taxonomic group biodiversity, **TBS**, saturation can also be calculated.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(summarySScores)
```

For each ecotope class, we can also compute the potential and actual
species specific scores for each ecotope. Their values for each
species and ecotope areas are given in the following two cells, the
first one shows their potential scores, **SEcoPot**, while the latter
contains their actual scores, **SEcoAct**.


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(SEcoPot)
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(SEcoAct)
```

For each taxonomic group and for each ecotope class, the sum of SEcoPot
can be calculated as **PTE**, potential taxonomic group ecotope constant.


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(PTE)
```

For each taxonomic group and for each ecotope class, the sum of SEcoAct
can be calculated as **ATE**, actual taxonomic group ecotope constant.


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(ATE)
```

Based on ATE and PTE, we can calculate **TES**, taxonomic group ecotope
saturation index, for each taxonomic group and ecotope area.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(TES)
```

Based on PTB and PTE, we can calculate **TEI**, taxonomic group ecotope
importance constant, for each taxonomic group and ecotope area.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(TEI)
```

Based on TEI and TES, we can calculate **ATEI** (ATE in the paper), actual
taxonomic group ecotope constant, for each taxonomic group and ecotope
area.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(ATEI)
```

Based on the ecotopeArea assumed above and TEI, the potential taxonomic
group flood plain importance score, **TFI** (PotTax in the paper), can be
calculated as follows.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(TFI)
```

The sum of TFI is reported as **FI** (PotAll in the paper), the potential floodplain
importance score.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(FI)
```

Based on the ecotopeArea assumed above and ATEI, the actual taxonomic
group flood plain importance score, **ATFI** (ActTax in the paper), can be
calculated as follows.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(ATFI)
```

The sum of ATFI is reported as the actual floodplain importance score, **AFI** (ActAll in the paper).


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(AFI)
```

Based on AFI and FI, we can calculated the floodplain importance saturation, **FIS** (SatAll
in the paper), as follows.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(FIS)
```

For each taxonomic group, the taxonomic group floodplain importance
saturation, **TFIS** (SatTax in the paper), can be calculated based on ATFI
and FIS. TFIS describes the fraction/saturation of actual over potential
biodiversity.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(TFIS)
```

Based on TEI and ecotopeArea, we can calculate **TFHS** (HabDiv in the
paper), the taxonomic group floodplain habitat saturation, which
describes the fraction of suitable ecotopes, weighed by law, for each
taxonomic group.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(TFHS)
```


``` code
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(FTEI)
# FTEI is not found in the paper.
# FTEI: Floodplain Taxonomic group Ecotope Importance
```

Running the BIOSAFE in a spatial mode
=====================================

In the following cells, we will demonstrate the BIOSAFE model in a
spatial model. The BIOSAFE model will be fed by spatial data, particularly on ecotope distribution and species monitoring data.

We assume the following floodplain section map **flpl\_sections**, which would be loaded and vizualized by executing the following notebook cells.


``` code
flpl_sections_f = os.path.join(output_folder, 'flpl_sections.map')
flpl_sections = pcr.readmap(flpl_sections_f)
```


``` code
plot(flpl_sections)
```

The following ecotope map **ecotopes** would be assumed.


``` code
ecotopes = biosafe.read_map_with_legend(os.path.join(output_folder, 'ecotopes.map'))
```


``` code
#~ # plot the ecotope map (not needed)
#~ plot(ecotopes.pcr_map)
```

For the input related to species monitoring data, the following data frame of **ndff_species** is used (i.e. related to species presence and characteristics).


``` code
ndff_species = pd.read_pickle(os.path.join(output_folder, 'ndff_sub_BS_13.pkl'))
```


``` code
# Note: This cell is for visualizing data only and may be heavy.
# You may want to skip it or clear its output after executing it.
# ndff_species.shape
# bsIO.show_full_data_frame(ndff_species)
```

Given the inputs defined above, we can initiate the BIOSAFE model in a
spatial model by running the following cell. Note that the inputs of
**speciesPresence** and **ecotopoArea** are calculated based on the aformentioned inputs of **ndff_species**, **ecotopes**, and **flpl_sections**. For this example, we would calculate the
scores **FI** and **TFI**.


``` code
bs_spatial = biosafe.spatialBiosafe(bs, ecotopes, flpl_sections, ndff_species,
                            params = ['FI', 'TFI'],
                            toFiles = None)
FI, TFI = bs_spatial.spatial()
```

The calculated TFI values are given as follows, for each taxonomic group and for each floodplain section.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(TFI)
```

Then, for each flood plain section, the calculated FI value is given as follows.


``` code
bsIO.show_full_data_frame(FI)
```

Assessing biodiversity change, before and after measure
===================================================

The exercise in the following cells is an exercise to access such a floodplain
measure to biodiversity change.

We assume such a measure is implemented in the following ecotope map
**msr_eco**.


``` code
msr_eco = biosafe.read_map_with_legend(os.path.join(output_folder, 'ecotopes_msr.map'))
```


``` code
#~ # plot the ecotope map (not needed)
#~ plot(msr_eco.pcr_map)
```

Note that this measure is only implemented in some parts of the model
area (not for all floodplain IDs). Its reference/existing condition
(before the measure), which is taken from them map **ecotopes** map, is
given as **ref\_eco**.


``` code
msr_area = pcr.defined(msr_eco.pcr_map)
sections = pcr.ifthen(msr_area, pcr.nominal(1))
ref_eco = biosafe.LegendMap(pcr.ifthen(msr_area, ecotopes.pcr_map), msr_eco.legend_df)
```

The flood plain sections where the measure is implemented are illustrated below. We will evaluate biodiversity change within this area.


``` code
plot(sections)
```


``` code
#~ # plot the ecotope map (not needed)
#~ plot(ref_eco.pcr_map)
```

Biodiversity before the measure
----------------------------------------------

The BIOSAFE model for the reference/existing condition is calculated as
follows. For this exercise, we just calculate the scores **FI** and **TFI** (with the subscript **ref** indicating the reference condition, before the measure).


``` code
bs_ref = biosafe.spatialBiosafe(bs, ref_eco, sections, ndff_species,
                        params = ['FI', 'TFI'], toFiles = None)
FI_ref, TFI_ref = bs_ref.spatial()
```

Biodiversity after the measure
----------------------------------------------

The BIOSAFE model for the measure condition is calculated as follows. We also calculate the scores **FI** and **TFI** (with the subscript **msr** indicating the condition after the measure).


``` code
bs_msr = biosafe.spatialBiosafe(bs, msr_eco, sections, ndff_species,
                        params = ['FI', 'TFI'], toFiles = None)
FI_msr, TFI_msr = bs_msr.spatial()
```

Evaluating biodiversity change
----------------------------------------------

After implemeting the BIOSAFE model for the before and after measures, **bs_ref** and **bs_msr**, we can compare their scores.

We can compare and plot the **TFI** scores, before and after the
measure.


``` code
#%% activating matplotlib visualization
%matplotlib notebook
```


``` code
sns.set_style("ticks")
# TFI_ref.drop(['xcoor', 'ycoor'], axis=1).plot.bar()
# TFI_msr.drop(['xcoor', 'ycoor'], axis=1).plot.bar()

comparison = pd.concat([TFI_ref, TFI_msr]).drop(['xcoor', 'ycoor'], axis=1)
comparison.index = ['Reference', 'Measures']
comparison.columns = [u'Birds', u'Butterflies', u'Dragon- and damselflies',
                    u'Fish', u'Herpetofauna', u'Higher plants', u'Mammals']
comparison.columns.name = 'Taxonomic group'

comparison.plot.bar(rot=0)


plt.savefig('comparison_biosafe_TFI.png', dpi=300)
comparison.to_csv('comparison_biosafe_TFI.csv')
```

We can also compare and plot the **FI** scores, before and after the
measure, by running the following cells.


``` code
sns.set_style("ticks")
# FI_ref.drop(['xcoor', 'ycoor'], axis=1).plot.bar()
# FI_msr.drop(['xcoor', 'ycoor'], axis=1).plot.bar()

comparison = pd.concat([FI_ref, FI_msr]).drop(['xcoor', 'ycoor'], axis=1)
comparison.index = ['Reference', 'Measures']
comparison.plot.bar(rot=0)

plt.savefig('comparison_biosafe_FI.png', dpi=300)
comparison.to_csv('comparison_biosafe_FI.csv')
```


``` code

```
